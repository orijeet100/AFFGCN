# 3、Weather Dataset

The weather dataset for this article is from [the Iowa Atmospheric Observatory website](http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml) at Iowa State University in the United States, which records historical weather data for most parts of the world. You can download the corresponding dataset by selecting seven steps on the website, including country and region, weather characteristics, and time and date. The downloaded weather data is a txt file. By manually converting it into a CSV file and setting the separator, you can better observe the initial state of the weather data.

To match weather data that matches traffic data, download the corresponding weather data from the mesonet website (Iowa State University's Iowa Atmospheric Observatory network) based on the time and location of the traffic dataset. Firstly, the order of the weather time series corresponding to the time stamp is not processed. Features 15, 19, 24, 25, and 26 are not selected without data collection. Features 21, 22, and 23 are not selected due to the absence of ice accumulation in the time and location corresponding to the traffic dataset. Finally, the time stamp and 17 weather features remain.
